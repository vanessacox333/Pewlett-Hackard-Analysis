# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview: 

Pewlett Hackard anticipates a large number of its employees to be retiring over the next few years. The management team wants to know the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to help train the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. A "silver tsunami" refers to the large number of aging seniors in many world economies. This analysis was conducted to help Pewlett Hackard prepare for the potential "silver tsunami" coming to for their company.


## Results:

There is clearly not enough individuals eligible for the mentorship program to train the amount of people needed to fill all the open positions that will soon become available. Other plans need to be put in place to properly staff and train the new (and large) incoming group of new staff.
